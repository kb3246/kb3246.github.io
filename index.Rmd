# *Welcome!* 

I'm **Kasturi Bhamidipati**, and this is my website! 

Here, you will find information about me, including my professional and academic experience and my contact information, including links to my email and GitHub. You will also find a flexdashboard containing three distinct graphs from the ` NY NOAA` dataset. 

I hope you enjoy looking through it, and please reach out if you have any comments and suggestions to improve your experience! 

# *Who am I?*

I'm a second year MPH student at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. I grew up in India and moved to New York City for grad school. I enjoy exploring new places to eat, walking around Central Park and reading books. I also love baking and watching Formula-1.

# *Flexdashboard*

I created three distinct plots (bar, scatter and line) using a random sample (n= 20,000) from the [NY NOAA](https://p8105.com/dataset_noaa.html) dataset. Click [here](dashboard.html) to navigate to the dashboard.

- The scatter plot shows the distribution of `tmin` vs `tmax`.
- The line plot displays the maximum temperatures recorded over 5 years (2006-2010), for each month. 
- The bar plot shows the maximum precipitation recorded in each month of the year 2010.


*This website was created for an [assignment](https://p8105.com/homework_4.html) for the [Data Science P8105 course](https://p8105.com) in Fall 2022.*
