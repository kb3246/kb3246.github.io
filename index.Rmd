# *Welcome!* 

I'm Kasturi, and this is my website! 

Here, you will find information about me, including my professional and academic experience and my contact information, including links to my email and GitHub.   

You will also find a flexdashboard made using `plotly` containing three distinct graphs from the ` NY NOAA` dataset. 

I hope you enjoy looking through it, and please reach out if you have any comments and suggestions to improve your experience!
